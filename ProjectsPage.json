Each four-day event featured extensive print—stadium banners, bus and hotel ads, maps, merchandise, and even custom medals—alongside interactive crowd experiences like kiss cams and emoji cams. I designed over 150 motion graphics event bumpers, automatically generated from event data to match branding, music, colors, and mascot placement, and led the creation of a full year of social media content. While collaborating with a team, I personally handled all motion design and directed the overall visual identity.",

Inspired by Haifa’s history, the branding has a gritty, vintage feel that reflects the city while keeping the art as the main focus. The team and I worked to make the gallery inviting to passersby and engaging online, collaborating closely with officials and the curator. Practical considerations, like durable materials and precise measurements for the irregular fence, were balanced with creative goals. I’m especially proud of the logo, which anchors the identity and captures the spirit of the exhibition.",

The comic style aimed to make the athletes’ incredible achievements feel heroic, turning them into larger-than-life figures. One of the main challenges was curating the images, as not every photo translated well into this style. Working closely with the team, we applied the branding across materials while keeping the focus on the athletes’ energy and accomplishments.",

The identity was inspired by the power and strength of Jerusalem, incorporating the city’s lion to reflect this energy. A key challenge was unifying the vision of multiple officials while building an event that didn’t exist before, ensuring the branding was cohesive and compelling. I handled the entire motion design and logo creation myself, and I’m especially proud of the mascot and its applications, as well as the social media branding that helped bring the event to life. The project also required approvals from European officials, adding an extra layer of coordination and precision.",

The challenge was to make the design feel personal and unique while still harmonizing with the client’s existing olive oil products. I chose all the colors, typography, and visual elements to create a cohesive, nostalgic look, working closely with the client to balance their vision with my design. I’m especially proud of the warm, inviting atmosphere the packaging conveys, making the product feel both authentic and memorable.",

The branding drew inspiration from water, the sea, the Star of David, and the sunny atmosphere of Netanya.
